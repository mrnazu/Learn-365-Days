# OAuth

# What is **OAuth**

- OAuth, which stands for “**Open Authorization**,” in short word it allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password.
- When a user wants to access a resource from a third-party application, they are redirected to the authorization server. The authorization server then authenticates the user and asks them if they would like to grant the third-party application access to their resources. If the user agrees, then the authorization server issues an access token which is used by the third-party application to gain access to the user’s resources. The access token is usually short-lived and must be renewed periodically in order for the third-party application to continue accessing the user’s resources.
- For example, you can tell Facebook that it’s OK for `ESPN.com` to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having to give ESPN your Facebook password. This minimizes risk in a major way: In the event ESPN suffers a breach, your Facebook password remains safe.

# Real world **Examples of OAuth**

- Google: Google uses OAuth to allow users to log into third-party websites and applications using their Google account.
- Facebook: Facebook uses OAuth to allow users to log into third-party websites and applications using their Facebook account.
- Twitter: Twitter uses OAuth to allow users to log into third-party websites and applications using their Twitter account.

# **SAML vs. OAuth**

- SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language. It is a type of technology that helps to securely share information between two different systems.
    - For example, if a student wants to log into their school's online learning system, they would use SAML to securely share their username and password with the school's system. This way, the student can be sure that their information is safe and secure.
- SAML and OAuth are both authentication protocols used to verify the identity of a user.
    - SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an open standard that allows users to securely log in to a website or application using their existing credentials from another website or application. For example, if you have an account with Google, you can use your Google credentials to log in to a different website that supports SAML.
    - OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard that allows users to securely access resources from another website or application without having to provide their credentials each time. For example, if you have an account with Facebook, you can use your Facebook credentials to access other websites or applications without having to enter your username and password each time.

# **OpenID**

- OpenID is a way to use one account to sign in to many different websites. For example, if you have an OpenID account, you can use it to sign in to websites like YouTube, Facebook, and Google. It's like having one key that opens many different doors!

# Explain for kid

- OAuth is a way for people to securely access websites or applications without having to give out their username and password. It's like a key that unlocks the door to a website or app.
- For example, if you wanted to use your Facebook account to log in to another website, you could use OAuth. Instead of giving the website your Facebook username and password, you would click on the "Log in with Facebook" button. This would open up a window where you could log in with your Facebook account without giving out any of your personal information. Once you're logged in, the website can access some of your information from Facebook, like your name and profile picture.
