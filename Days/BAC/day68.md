# ****Lab 2: Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL****

This lab has an unprotected admin panel. It's located at an unpredictable location, but the location is disclosed somewhere in the application.

- When it say "**unprotected admin panel**" it means it is not secured with any form of protection, like a username and password.

Solve the lab by accessing the admin panel, and using it to delete the user `carlos`.

   adminPanelTag.innerText = 'Admin panel';
   topLinksTag.append(adminPanelTag);
