# Intro

- I am the CEO and one of the co-founders of futurevera.thm. In Futurevera, we believe that the future is in space. **We do a lot of space research and write blogs about it**. We used to help students with space questions, but we are rebuilding our support.

- **Recon & hacking**
    
    **First of all:**
    
    `sudo nano /etc/hosts` then add this `10.10.6.84 futurevera.thm`
    
    **We know what we do that means our task is all about sub domain enumration. seems easyðŸ˜Š**
    
    - **SSH is openðŸ¥¸**
    1. **btw, we can check the source code if there is a mentioned sub-domain**
        
        **but there is nothing intersting thingðŸ˜¢**
        
        ![source code.jpg](TakeOver%20e6a7eafa779f414698ef9e8e047b68b1/source_code.jpg)
        
    
    **Let's go ahead and enumerate a subdomain using knockpy(my fav sub-domain scanner tools ever!)** 
    
    ```
    â”Œâ”€â”€(nazuã‰¿Nazu)-[~/Desktop/CTF/THM-CTF/TakeOver]
    â””â”€$ knockpy futurevera.thm
    # then we found: 
    portal.futurevera.thm 
    blog.futurevera.thm
    support.futurevera.thm
    ```
    
    **So now, we have to add this portal subdomain into `/etc/hosts`**
    
    - **3 thing you have to do while testing subdomain takeover.**
        - **the first one is checking source code like before,**
        - **the seconde one is checking domina under a domain maybe 3 or 4 times dom1.dom2.dom3.dom4.maindomâ€¦. using tools such as knockpy, amass..**
        - **the third one is osint and checking certificate**
    
    **portal.futurevera.thm:**
