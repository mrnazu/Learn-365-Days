# Domain & Sub-Domain

Starting point

# Domain & Sub-Domain

- A domain name is an address associated with a web site, such as `www.nazu.org`. A sub-domain is an additional level of domain name, such as `help.nazu.org` or `shop.nazu.org`, which all point to a single website but are used to separate specific sections of the website from each other. Sub-domains can be used for marketing and organizational purposes, as well as for technical reasons like load balancing or managing access rights for different parts of the website or application.
- or in other explanation HTTP domain and subdomain is a web hosting technique used to divide or separate resources stored in the server so that multiple websites can run on the same system

## For Hackers

- This can be useful for bug bounty hunters and Hackers since each section might contain different vulnerabilities and attack vectors than the main domain itself. Additionally, a large organization may have several separate subdomains controlling various aspects of the domain, so there are more opportunities to find security holes or bugs in these areas.

# How to Create a Subdomain?

- Log in to your hosting provider's control panel. For example, if you have a web host like Bluehost or HostGator, you can usually access the control panel from the home page of their website.
- Look for an option that says “Domains” or “Subdomains.” It should be located in the navigation menu on the left side of your screen. Click on it and then select the domain name you want to work with.
- Once you’re on the domain-specific page, look for a link or button that says something like “Create Subdomain” or “Manage Subdomains.” Depending on which hosting provider you use, this may be located in different places within the interface; just look around until you find it.
- On the next page, enter the name of your new subdomain (e.g., blog) into the form field and click “Create” to confirm your changes and finish setting up the new subdomain. Your hosting provider will provide instructions or ask further questions as needed to complete this step.
