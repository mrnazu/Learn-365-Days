# What is a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?

A web application firewall (WAF) is an appliance or software designed to protect your web applications from malicious attacks, such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), code injection and other application layer attacks.

# How Does a Web Application Firewall Work?

A WAF functions by monitoring incoming traffic for patterns that may indicate malicious activity. It then blocks requests before they can reach the web server so any malicious code is kept from being executed in the backend of your website or service. Depending on your WAF, it may also respond to authentication challenges before allowing requests to continue through to a protected asset.

# What Are The Benefits Of A Web Application Firewall?

A web application firewall offers many benefits: it filters out suspicious behavior, strengthens security measures by blocking exploits, and helps maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations such as HIPAA or GDPR. Additionally, a well-configured WAF can reduce false positives and can help improve website performance by blocking unnecessary overhead requests that would otherwise bog down your resources.

# How Can I Integrate A Web Application Firewall Into My System?

Integrating a WAF into your system involves selecting the right product for you based on things like compatibility with other security appliances, scalability requirements, licensing terms and cost effectiveness. In most cases you will need some sort of hosting platform for installing the WAF depending on if you are deploying on virtualized infrastructure or physical hardware in your datacenter or at a cloud provider’s location; there are many options available from traditional appliances from vendors such as Akamai, Radware, F5 Networks and many more available through cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You can also find user friendly do-it-yourself solutions such as Cloudflare’s Universal SSL offering that comes with their WAF offering included!
