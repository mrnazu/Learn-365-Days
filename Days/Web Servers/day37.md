## The purpose of a web server

A web server's purpose is to host a website or web application, delivering HTML documents and other related web resources such as JavaScript and CSS files, over the internet. The web server accepts requests from browsers (such as Google Chrome or Firefox) and return responses, usually in the form of HTML documents.

## How do web servers work?

When a user enters a URL into their web browser, the browser sends a request to the server. The server then looks up the requested page and sends it back to the user's device.

For example, when you enter "`www.example.com`" into your web browser, your browser sends a request to the server hosting `example.com`. The server then looks up the requested page and sends it back to your device in the form of HTML code. Your browser then interprets this code and displays the page on your screen.

## Apache
